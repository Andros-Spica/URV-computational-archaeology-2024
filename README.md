## Simulation and Agent-based modelling
In this module, you will learn the core concepts of simulation, particularly Agent-Based Modelling (ABM), as it is often used in archaeology to represent socio-ecological processes. Simulation modelling is mainly about formalising explanatory models (those we intuitively use), considering our current knowledge or assumptions and data. We will not focus on the technical skills in this methodology but rather on developing a basic understanding of the potential and limits of simulation in archaeology.

### Session 1
This section introduces simulation as a scientific methodology and provides an overview of its application in archaeology, particularly in the context of socioecological systems.

Slides: https://andros-spica.github.io/URV-computational-archaeology-2024/

### Autonomous work
Read Romanowska, Wren & Cabtree 2021 (Chapters 0 and 1).
Read the “Introduction” and Block A sections of the tutorial “Andros-Spica/ABM-Tutorial-Koeln-2022” (https://github.com/Andros-Spica/ABM-tutorial-koeln-2022).

### Session 2
How do we go from data to interpretations that require causality and certain generalisation? Here we will not go into the technical side of computational modelling (i.e. programming) but rather perform a guided "pen-and-paper" exercise about the first and most challenging steps in simulation modelling: the definition of a system of interest in relation to our question/hypotheses, and the formalisation of the entities or factors and causal relationships considered to be involved. For this, you will need no more than pen and paper, a subject of interest, good old diagramming skills, and an open mind.

## Archaeogaming
This module will briefly present a growing field within digital archaeology and humanities, Archaeogaming. With an immense diversity of manifestations, this field explores the intersection of archaeology, history and heritage studies with games, particularly video games, and innovative approaches in education and immersive technologies.
 
### Session 1
This is an introduction to the concept and field of research generally known as archaeogaming. We will overview the value of games as learning tools and consider various implications of using video games to represent the past based on a growing variety of areas of research.

Slides: https://andros-spica.github.io/URV-computational-archaeology-2024/

### Autonomous work
Read at least one of the articles or chapters from the reference list.

Play at least two (video)games that either claim or you believe represent archaeological research or the past.
